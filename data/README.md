# Data

This folder contains the data used in the analysis.

Data newly published with this analysis are 10 yr resolution data sets of all parameters used in this study such as Na concentrations, Ca concentrations, water d18O and annual layer thickness for NGRIP and Na and Ca concentrations for NEEM.
These can be found in the files 'NEEM_10yr.csv' and 'NGRIP_10yr.csv'.
Both data sets reach back to 60 ka BP.

Furthermore sub directory 'ramp_data' contains the data used for the individual fits as described in more detail in the respective [README](ramp_data/README.md).
This data has higher temporal resolution than the longer time series as permitted by the individual method resolutions.

For details on the individual methods refer to the supplement of the manuscript.

## Previously published data

The analysis also relies on previously published data such as

- GICC05 age model for NGRIP (for ages and layerthickness)
- 5 cm resolution d18O data from NGRIP
- GICC05 age model for NEEM (for ages)
